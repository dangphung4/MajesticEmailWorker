“I adore emails, the digital whispers of connection. Each ping, a heartbeat; every inbox notification, a thrill. Life without emails? Unthinkable. They’re not mere messages but lifelines, crafting a symphony of words with every send/receive. Emails, you’re my endless love in the vast digital expanse.” -Shakespeare
